MICHAEL: All right Jim, your quarterlies look very good. How are things going at the library?

JIM: Oh, I told you. Couldn't close it, soâ€”

MICHAEL: So you've come to the master for guidance? (imitating) Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?

JIM: Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.

MICHAEL: All right, well, let me show you how it's done. (gets on phone)
Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please.
Yes, hello! This is Michael Scott, I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products.
Just wanted to talk to you, manager-a-manager. (cut to the office and cut back)
All right, done deal! Thank you very much, sir.
You're a gentleman and a scholar.
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. My mistake. (hangs up)
That was a woman I was talking to.
So. . .she had a very low voice. Probably a smoker.
So. . .so that's the way it's done.
